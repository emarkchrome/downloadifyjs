# Downloadify.js
### 📥 Quickly implement platform-specific download links on your website
Downloadify.js is a a small **1.3kb** library that takes the pain out of writing code for your download links to accommodate different platforms.

The quick setup __dynamically__ changes the URL of your download link depending on whether the user is on Windows, MacOS, or Linux.

## Install
Simply copy the code from dist/downloadify.min.js and paste it into a js file. Use in any web project!

## Usage
```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Download Test</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <button type="button" id="button">Download Here</button>
    <script src="downloadify.js"></script>
    <script>
      var button = document.getElementById('button');

      var downloadify = new Downloadify(button, navigator, {
        windows: 'https://google.com',
        macos: 'https://bing.com',
        linux: 'https://medium.com',
        fallback: 'https://yahoo.com'
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
## Future Improvements
It only supports the three platforms, and a fallback link in case the user is not on one of these 3 platforms, but I'll improve on it in the future.
